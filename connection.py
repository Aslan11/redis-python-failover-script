#Simple test for redis failures
#input - none
#output - UUID to stdout and written to DB for troubleshooting
#   timestamp to indicate start
#   one line per second (loop iteration) showing:
#       timestamp and successful write or failure with loop iteration
#   timestamp to indication stop
#   number of seconds redis was up (iterations)

#Display every second that Redis master is working properlyÂ 
#In case of a failure, show the time in seconds Redis was not available
